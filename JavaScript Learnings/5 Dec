To Do:
1. Need to migrate the activityTypes along with render Types
2. Need to create the mappings for the fields of activity Types in Snowflake to the mongodb schema and trigger an api.
3. Need to run the script to push the activityTypes to mongo in local.


Edge Cases in Activity Migration:
1. If the prospectId of the activities are not present
2. If the mandatory fields are not being passed.
3. If the field schema is failing
4. Need to tackle if the field schema for non mandatory fields is incorrect
